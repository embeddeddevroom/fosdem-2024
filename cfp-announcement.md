This email is a Call For Participation in the Embedded, Mobile and
Automotive Devroom at FOSDEM 2024.


Devroom date: February 3rd 2024 in Brussels, Belgium
CFP deadline: Friday, December 8th 2023.

Final speaker confirmation on Friday, December 15th 2023.


CFP Introduction
---------------------------

Embedded software is transforming the world, and FOSS embedded software
is leading the way. From automotive to the Internet of Things,
launching rockets, messing with your phone or automating your toaster,
small devices, embedded systems, and automatons are everywhere
Join in and tell the world about your project!

This year we welcome talks that are either:
* 10 min (short introduction of project/topic)
* 25 min (normal slot)
* 50 min (extraordinary slot for a topic that needs a deeper explanation)

Topics Sought
------------------------

The embedded devroom seeks topics related to automotive, industrial,
mobile, consumer electronics, autonomous and generally embedded
systems, either from a professional or hobbyist background. Topics
such as operating systems (Linux, free RTOS), hardware platforms (from
microcontrollers to microprocessors, FPGAs) and software stacks are
welcome. Related areas are of course of interest as well and our
definition of "embedded" is elastic.
