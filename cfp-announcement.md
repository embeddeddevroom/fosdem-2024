Automotive Devroom at FOSDEM 2024.

CFP deadline: Friday, December 8th 2023.

CFP Introduction
---------------------------

Embedded software is transforming the world, and FOSS embedded software
is leading the way. From automotive to the Internet of Things,
launching rockets, messing with your phone or automating your toaster,
small devices, embedded systems, and automatons are everywhere.
Join in and tell the world about your project!

This year we welcome talks that are either:
* 10 min (short introduction of project/topic)
* 25 min (normal slot)
* 50 min (extraordinary slot for a topic that needs a deeper explanation)

Topics Sought
------------------------

The embedded devroom seeks topics related to automotive, industrial,
mobile, consumer electronics, autonomous and generally embedded
systems, either from a professional or hobbyist background. Topics
such as operating systems (Linux, FreeRTOS), hardware platforms (from
microcontrollers to microprocessors, FPGAs) and software stacks are
welcome. Related areas are of course of interest as well and our
definition of "embedded" is elastic.
